# 🛡️ SupraWall Plugins Monorepo

**The Industry-Standard Deterministic Security Layer for AI Agents.**

SupraWall solves the "trust" problem in generative AI by providing a zero-knowledge, deterministic security layer between LLMs and your production systems. Unlike probabilistic security models, SupraWall enforces strict business policies and forensic-grade threat detection before an agentic action even reaches your API.

## 🏛️ Project Vision

SupraWall (formerly AgentGate) was built to bridge the gap between high-velocity AI experimentation and enterprise security compliance. Our goal is to empower developers to ship autonomous agentic fleets without the risk of Prompt Injection, PII data leakage, or uncontrolled tool execution.

This monorepo serves as the official distribution hub for all SupraWall plugins and framework integrations.

## 🚦 Quick Start

### For Dify Marketplace Users
We represent the most robust security option on the [Dify Marketplace](https://cloud.dify.ai/plugins). To install manually during the initial review phase, use the pre-packaged `.difypkg` found in the `suprawall-security` directory.

### For Claude Desktop Users
Add SupraWall to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "suprawall": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@suprawall/mcp-plugin"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Architecture
SupraWall is built on three core pillars:
1. **Detection**: Real-time identification of adversarial intent (Prompt Injection, SQLi, Jailbreaks).
2. **Scrubbing**: Automatic removal of PII (Names, Emails, Keys) before data leaves your environment.
3. **Enforcement**: Strict policy-based execution—if a tool call doesn't match your rule, it's blocked.
